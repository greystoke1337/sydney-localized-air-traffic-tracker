# Overhead // Live Aircraft Tracker

A real-time tracker that shows **which aircraft are flying directly above any location in the world**, built as a single HTML file with no dependencies or backend required.

## Features

### Location & Filtering
- **Worldwide location search** — type any city, suburb, or address anywhere in the world
- **Adjustable geofence radius** — slider from 2km to 20km; the map circle updates live and the next auto-refresh applies the new radius
- **Altitude floor** — slider from 200ft to 5,000ft filters out low-flying helicopters or taxiing aircraft
- **Persisted settings** — location, geofence radius, and altitude floor are saved to `localStorage` and restored on next visit
- **Share link** — the ↗ SHARE button copies a `?location=` URL to the clipboard; anyone opening it lands directly on your location

### Live Data
- **Live ADS-B data** via [airplanes.live](https://airplanes.live), routed through a self-hosted proxy at [api.overheadtracker.com](https://api.overheadtracker.com) — free, no API key required
- **Auto-refresh** every 15 seconds; countdown resets cleanly after each fetch completes
- **Manual refresh** — REFRESH button triggers an immediate fetch and resets the countdown
- **Stale-request cancellation** — any in-flight API request is aborted before a new one starts, preventing stale data from overwriting fresh results

### Flight Information
- **Airline lookup** — airline name derived from the ICAO callsign prefix (e.g. QFA001 → Qantas)
- **Full aircraft type names** — ICAO type codes translated to readable names (e.g. B789 → B787-9, A20N → A320neo); covers Boeing, Airbus, Embraer, ATR, CRJ, turboprops, business jets, military, and helicopters
- **Flight phase detection** — classifies each aircraft as LANDING, TAKING OFF, APPROACH, DESCENDING, CLIMBING, or OVERHEAD based on altitude and vertical speed
- **Emergency squawk highlighting** — 7700 (MAYDAY), 7600 (NORDO), and 7500 (HIJACK) are displayed in red with a ⚠ warning
- **Altitude display** — Flight Level notation above 10,000ft (FL350), QNH feet below

### Map
- **Live map** — Leaflet map with dark CartoDB tiles; shows the geofence circle, location marker, and a dashed line from the aircraft to your location
- **Speed-scaled heading vector** — directional arrow from the aircraft dot, scaled by ground speed (100kt = ~1km, 500kt = ~5km) with a chevron arrowhead

### Visual Design
- **Phase colour bleed** — the info block's left border and glow change colour with flight phase (red for landing, green for climbing, amber for approach)
- **Altitude bar** — a thin vertical bar on the info block fills proportionally to altitude (0–45,000ft)
- **CRT scanline effect** — a fixed 5% opacity horizontal line overlay for the dot-matrix aesthetic
- **Aircraft photo** — fetched automatically from [Planespotters.net](https://planespotters.net) by registration, displayed as a hero image with a halftone dot overlay

### Navigation & UX
- **Keyboard navigation** — arrow keys to browse flights (disabled while typing in the location input)
- **NEAREST button** — jump back to the closest overhead aircraft instantly
- **Sound alert** — optional radar ping (🔊 SND button) when a new aircraft becomes #1 overhead; synthesised via Web Audio API, no audio files required
- **Session log** — collapsible list of every unique flight seen during the current session, with timestamps and phase labels
- **Responsive / mobile-friendly** — fluid layout, 44px minimum touch targets, fluid map and photo heights, no horizontal overflow

## ESP32 Hardware Display

A standalone physical tracker built on the **Freenove FNK0103S** (ESP32 + 4" 480×320 ST7796 touchscreen). It connects to your local network and displays live overhead flights on the TFT screen — no browser needed.

**Hardware**
- Freenove FNK0103S dev board (ESP32, HSPI)
- 4.0" 480×320 ST7796 display (landscape)
- Optional: 3D-printed enclosure (STL/STEP files in [`tracker_live_fnk0103s/enclosure/`](tracker_live_fnk0103s/enclosure/))

**Features**
- Polls the local proxy every 15 seconds; cycles through overhead flights every 8 seconds
- **Touchscreen location toggle** — tap `< REDACTED >` / `< SYDNEY ARPT >` in the header to switch location presets instantly; switching clears the flight list and triggers a fresh fetch
- Touchscreen calibration runs once on first boot and is saved to NVS
- Displays flight phase, altitude, callsign, aircraft type, airline, and distance

**Libraries required** (install via Arduino Library Manager)
- `TFT_eSPI` (Freenove pre-configured version)
- `ArduinoJson`
- `SD` (built into Arduino ESP32 core)

**Configuration**
Edit the top of [`tracker_live_fnk0103s/tracker_live_fnk0103s.ino`](tracker_live_fnk0103s/tracker_live_fnk0103s.ino) before flashing:
```cpp
const char* WIFI_SSID = "your-network";
const char* WIFI_PASS = "your-password";
const char* PROXY_HOST = "192.168.x.x";  // IP of your local proxy
```

**Build & flash** (`arduino-cli` required)
```bash
./build.sh            # compile + auto-detect port + upload
./build.sh compile    # compile only
./build.sh upload     # upload last build (auto-detect port)
./build.sh monitor    # open serial monitor
```

## How It Works

1. Geocodes the entered location via Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) — no API key needed; works worldwide
2. Queries [api.overheadtracker.com](https://api.overheadtracker.com) (a self-hosted Raspberry Pi proxy backed by airplanes.live) for all aircraft within a radius derived from the geofence size (4× the geofence in nautical miles, to cast a wider net)
3. Filters precisely to aircraft within the geofence radius and above the altitude floor
4. Sorts by distance — closest overhead first
5. Renders flight data, map (with heading vector), altitude bar, phase colour bleed, and photo
6. Repeats every 15 seconds; slider changes are picked up on the next auto-refresh without triggering extra API calls

## Usage

Just open `index.html` in a browser. No server, no build step, no API keys needed.

> **Note:** The app makes requests to `api.overheadtracker.com` (flight data proxy), `nominatim.openstreetmap.org` (geocoding), and `api.planespotters.net` (photos). All are served over HTTPS and support CORS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greystoke1337/sydney-localized-air-traffic-tracker.git
cd sydney-localized-air-traffic-tracker
open index.html
```
