# Sydney Localized Air Traffic Tracker

A real-time tracker that shows **which aircraft are flying directly above any Australian suburb**, built as a single HTML file with no dependencies or backend required.

## Features

### Location & Filtering
- **Worldwide location search** — type any city, suburb, or address anywhere in the world; defaults to Russell Lea, Sydney
- **Adjustable geofence radius** — slider from 2km to 20km; the map circle updates live and the next auto-refresh applies the new radius
- **Altitude floor** — slider from 200ft to 5,000ft filters out low-flying helicopters or taxiing aircraft
- **Persisted settings** — location, geofence radius, and altitude floor are saved to `localStorage` and restored on next visit
- **Share link** — the ↗ SHARE button copies a `?location=` URL to the clipboard; anyone opening it lands directly on your location

### Live Data
- **Live ADS-B data** via [airplanes.live](https://airplanes.live) — free, no API key required
- **Auto-refresh** every 15 seconds; countdown resets cleanly after each fetch completes
- **Manual refresh** — REFRESH button triggers an immediate fetch and resets the countdown
- **Stale-request cancellation** — any in-flight API request is aborted before a new one starts, preventing stale data from overwriting fresh results

### Flight Information
- **Airline lookup** — airline name derived from the ICAO callsign prefix (e.g. QFA001 → Qantas)
- **Full aircraft type names** — ICAO type codes translated to readable names (e.g. B789 → B787-9, A20N → A320neo); covers Boeing, Airbus, Embraer, ATR, CRJ, turboprops, business jets, military, and helicopters
- **Flight phase detection** — classifies each aircraft as LANDING, TAKING OFF, APPROACH, DESCENDING, CLIMBING, or OVERHEAD based on altitude, vertical speed, and distance from SYD
- **Emergency squawk highlighting** — 7700 (MAYDAY), 7600 (NORDO), and 7500 (HIJACK) are displayed in red with a ⚠ warning
- **Altitude display** — Flight Level notation above 10,000ft (FL350), QNH feet below

### Map
- **Live map** — Leaflet map with dark CartoDB tiles; shows the geofence circle, suburb marker, and a dashed line from the aircraft to your location; SYD is pulled into view when within 40km of the suburb
- **Speed-scaled heading vector** — directional arrow from the aircraft dot, scaled by ground speed (100kt = ~1km, 500kt = ~5km) with a chevron arrowhead

### Visual Design
- **Phase colour bleed** — the info block's left border and glow change colour with flight phase (red for landing, green for climbing, amber for approach)
- **Altitude bar** — a thin vertical bar on the info block fills proportionally to altitude (0–45,000ft)
- **CRT scanline effect** — a fixed 5% opacity horizontal line overlay for the dot-matrix aesthetic
- **Aircraft photo** — fetched automatically from [Planespotters.net](https://planespotters.net) by registration, displayed as a hero image with a halftone dot overlay

### Navigation & UX
- **Keyboard navigation** — arrow keys to browse flights (disabled while typing in the suburb input)
- **NEAREST button** — jump back to the closest overhead aircraft instantly
- **Sound alert** — optional radar ping (🔊 SND button) when a new aircraft becomes #1 overhead; synthesised via Web Audio API, no audio files required
- **Session log** — collapsible list of every unique flight seen during the current session, with timestamps and phase labels
- **Responsive / mobile-friendly** — fluid layout, 44px minimum touch targets, fluid map and photo heights, no horizontal overflow

## How It Works

1. Geocodes the entered location via Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) — no API key needed; works worldwide
2. Queries airplanes.live for all aircraft within a radius derived from the geofence size (4× the geofence in nautical miles, to cast a wider net)
3. Filters precisely to aircraft within the geofence radius and above the altitude floor
4. Sorts by distance to suburb — closest overhead first
5. Renders flight data, map (with heading vector), altitude bar, phase colour bleed, and photo
6. Repeats every 15 seconds; slider changes are picked up on the next auto-refresh without triggering extra API calls

## Usage

Just open `index.html` in a browser. No server, no build step, no API keys needed.

> **Note:** The app makes requests to external APIs (`api.airplanes.live`, `nominatim.openstreetmap.org`, `api.planespotters.net`). These all support CORS. If you open the file over `http://` some browsers may block mixed-content requests — serve over `https://` or use a local server if you hit issues.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greystoke1337/sydney-localized-air-traffic-tracker.git
cd sydney-localized-air-traffic-tracker
open index.html
```
