# Overhead Tracker — Product Specification

## What it is

Real-time aircraft tracking that answers one question: "What planes are flying above me right now?" Set a location anywhere in the world, and it fetches live ADS-B data, filters to aircraft within your radius and altitude floor, and shows them sorted nearest-first.

---

## Why it exists

FlightRadar24 and similar apps show the whole world — you have to go find your location. This is location-first: you set one spot and only see aircraft directly above it. The secondary goal is a physical hardware display that needs no phone or browser.

**Web app (`index.html`)** — single HTML file, no build step, no framework. Deployed to GitHub Pages at `overheadtracker.com` on push to `main`.

**Raspberry Pi proxy (`server.js`)** — Node.js/Express on a Pi 3B+ at `192.168.86.24:3000`. Caches airplanes.live responses for 10 seconds so multiple clients can refresh at 15-second intervals without hitting rate limits. Exposed publicly via Cloudflare Tunnel. Managed by PM2.

**ESP32 TFT display (`.ino` firmware)** — Freenove FNK0103S, 4" 480×320 ST7796 touchscreen. Polls the local proxy over LAN, independent of the web app. Displays one flight at a time, cycling every 8 seconds.

## Data pipeline

1. **Geocode** — location string resolved to lat/lon via Nominatim. No API key.
2. **Fetch** — proxy queried with `lat`, `lon`, `radius` (4x the geofence in nautical miles).
3. **Filter** — reduced to aircraft within the geofence radius and above the altitude floor.
4. **Sort** — by haversine distance, closest first.
5. **Render** — flight info, map, photo, altitude bar, phase colour.
6. **Repeat** — every 15 seconds; any in-flight request is aborted before the next starts.

## Feature set (web app)

| Category | Features |
|---|---|
| **Location** | Worldwide search, persisted in `localStorage`, shareable via `?location=` URL param |
| **Filtering** | Geofence radius slider (2–20 km), altitude floor slider (200–5,000 ft) |
| **Flight data** | Callsign, airline name (from ICAO prefix), full aircraft type name, altitude (FL or QNH ft), ground speed, heading, vertical rate |
| **Flight phase** | TAKING OFF / CLIMBING / CRUISING / DESCENDING / APPROACH / LANDING / OVERHEAD — derived from altitude + vertical speed |
| **Map** | Leaflet with dark CartoDB tiles, geofence circle, aircraft dot, dashed line to location, speed-scaled heading vector with chevron |
| **Photo** | Aircraft registration photo from Planespotters.net, with halftone overlay |
| **Alerts** | Emergency squawk highlighting (7700/7600/7500), optional radar ping sound on new #1 aircraft |
| **Navigation** | Arrow key browsing, NEAREST button, session flight log |
| **UX** | CRT scanline aesthetic, phase colour bleed on info block border, altitude bar, mobile-responsive |

## Feature set (ESP32 display)

| Category | Features |
|---|---|
| **Config** | Captive portal on first boot — set Wi-Fi SSID/password and location; geocodes via Nominatim and stores to NVS |
| **Display** | Callsign, airline, aircraft type, altitude, distance, flight phase on a 480×320 TFT at 15s refresh / 8s cycle |
| **Touch** | GEO pill cycles geofence (5K / 10K / 50K); CFG pill opens captive portal |
| **Resilience** | Falls back from proxy → direct API → SD card cache (`cache.json`) |

## Deployment

- **Web app** — `git push` to `main`; GitHub Pages auto-deploys within ~60 seconds
- **Proxy** — SSH to `pi@piproxy.local`, edit `/home/pi/proxy/server.js`, `pm2 restart proxy`
- **ESP32** — `./build.sh` (compiles with `arduino-cli` and uploads)
