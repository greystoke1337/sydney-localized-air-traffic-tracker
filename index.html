  Single-file app — no server, no build step, no API keys.

  Flow: user types a location → geocode via OSM → query airplanes.live
        → filter to geofence → display flight data, map, photo → repeat every 15s

  Libraries: Leaflet.js (map), Google Fonts
  APIs: airplanes.live (ADS-B), Nominatim/OSM (geocoding),
        Planespotters.net (photos), CartoDB (map tiles)
